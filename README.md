## 🔧 Support and Troubleshooting

During installation or while using the application, you may face issues. Here are some common problems and solutions:

- **Database Access Issues:** Ensure you have entered the correct database name and credentials in the `config.php` file.

- **Error messages on the browser:** These might indicate missing files or incorrect paths. Double-check the folder name in the URL.
